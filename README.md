# Walt_Hickey_Halloween_Candy_Rankings
In 2017, Walt Hickey from FiveThirthyEight set out to find the Halloween candy most people prefer. To figure it out, he set up an experiment in which online voters could select their favorite candy from randomly generated matchups (for example, Twix or Snickers?). 

##Project objectives
The analysis aim to ascertain:
#1. Which candies have the highest win percentage? What do they have in common?
#2. Are more expensive candies more popular? What about sugary candies?
#3. Can you segment the candy into specific groups?
#4. If you had to pick 3 candies to give out in Halloween, which would they be?
